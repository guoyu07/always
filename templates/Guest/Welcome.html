        <p>The Student Memorial Program remembers and honors previously enrolled Appalachian students who have passed away.
    The plaque in the B.B. Dougherty Administration Building memorializes these students.
    Each Fall, Appalachian invites these students' families to campus for a special Student Memorial Program. During this program we honor and remember these
    Mountaineers by reading their names and families' words of remembrance.</p>
    
        <p class="lead" style="text-align:center;">These students will &ldquo;Always be a Mountaineer.&rdquo;</p>
